# Personal Project: Recommender System For E-Commerce Retail Businesses

This project shows a basic implementation for a recommender system adapted to e-commerce retail businesses.

Over the last few years there is a huge increment on small/mid size online based businesses to offer on their website the section for related products over the lens of “customers who viewed also viewed” or “customers who purchased also purchased”.

This falls, within the umbrella of data science, in the category of the recommender engines.

The goal of this project is to present a very basic approach, based on Truncated SVD, of how to build a recommender engine for small/mid sized e-commerce organizations.

The basic input data needed is just an standard sales/transactions database/table/file, the identification of the customer and the number of products it is desired to recommend using the model.

The code has been heavily commented to help out the interpretation and, at the end of the notebook, the is a "whiteboard" section where some coding trials have been made to help the code development.

Thanks and enjoy data science!

Eduardo.
